# Asogi

Asogi is a 3D generative ASCII art project that explores the intersection of structured algorithms and chaotic beauty. At its core, Asogi transforms the precision of code into stunning, dynamic visual experiences rendered entirely in ASCII characters. A unique blend of algorithmic complexity and chaos that challenges the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm.
