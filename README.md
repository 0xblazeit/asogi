# Asogi

Asogi is a 3D generative ASCII art project that explores the intersection of structured algorithms and chaotic beauty. At its core, Asogi transforms the precision of code into stunning, dynamic visual experiences rendered entirely in ASCII characters. A unique blend of algorithmic complexity and chaos that challenges the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm. Inspired by a [rotating donut](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html)

# Why Asogi?

"Asogi" symbolizes the creative tension between order and chaos—the foundation of generative art. It's where logic meets play, precision meets expression, and simplicity becomes profound.

Whether you're here to marvel at the possibilities of ASCII in 3D, contribute your own algorithms, or explore the code behind the art, Asogi welcomes you to a world where every pixel—every character—has a purpose.
